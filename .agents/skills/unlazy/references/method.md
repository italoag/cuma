# The Depth Tree

Use the tree to expose natural work boundaries and integration points. Do not treat depth as an arithmetic promise about effort or tokens.

The original v1 method claimed that each binary split multiplied effort. A small maintainer-run comparison later suggested that agents treated depth as a thoroughness cue rather than following that arithmetic. The repository does not contain the raw artifacts needed to reproduce those historical figures, so treat them as design history, not benchmark evidence. See [../research/validation-protocol.md](../research/validation-protocol.md).

## Rules

1. **Make layer 1 the requested task.** Split only at real domain, component, or verification boundaries. Binary splits are optional.
2. **Make each leaf one coherent deliverable.** Give it exact ownership, dependencies, and acceptance gates. Merge tiny adjacent leaves; split a leaf that hides several independent outcomes.
3. **Fix contracts before fan-out.** Reread the original request and current amendments. Inventory every independently omittable required outcome and acceptance-changing constraint in `PLAN.md`, then record interfaces, formats, shared assumptions, error conventions, naming, and ownership before a leaf starts.
4. **Give branches integration gates.** Verify child ledgers again, then test interfaces, end-to-end behavior, and regressions across the joined work.
5. **Use gates and passes as the effort control.** Finish implementation, expert reread, defect hunt, and low-cost polish. Stop only when every required gate has current evidence and another improvement pass finds nothing.

## Choose depth

- Use a shallow tree or solo ledger for a feature, contained bug hunt, or document.
- Use an orchestrated tree when several coherent deliverables benefit from fresh contexts or independent ownership.
- Use a deeper tree only when its additional branches correspond to real integration boundaries. Do not add empty hierarchy to satisfy a number.
- Honor an explicit `tree N` request while keeping leaves meaningful. If the requested depth would create filler leaves, state the mismatch and use the closest honest decomposition.

When no depth is requested, choose the smallest tree that exposes every independent deliverable and integration point.

## Contract checklist

Before dispatch, make these decisions explicit:

- stable contract item ids mapped to an owner and observing gate or manual review
- exact files or relative globs each leaf owns
- interfaces and schemas shared between leaves
- dependency ids and readiness states
- toolchain, shell, and working-directory requirements
- error and compatibility conventions
- which branch gates prove integration
- who performs high-risk manual review

Optional ideas are not requirements. Paraphrase only acceptance-relevant facts; never copy credentials, private request text, or unrelated context into repository state. Increment the contract revision when the user changes scope, reconcile every affected mapping before new dispatch, and use `REMOVED_BY_USER` only with explicit user authority.

Do not let two concurrent leaves own the same path. If shared work cannot be separated, make it an earlier dependency or a dedicated integration leaf.

## Completion hierarchy

| Layer | Proof |
|---|---|
| Leaf | Current runnable evidence plus reviewed manual evidence |
| Branch | Reverified children plus cross-child integration checks |
| Root | Current request reread, every contract row reconciled, every branch integrated, regressions checked, final claims remeasured |

Local completion does not imply integration. Verify from leaves upward and report only after the root ledger and current contract inventory are satisfied. A missing owner or observation, stale reference, abandonment, deferment, or owner decision is a visible handoff, not completion.
