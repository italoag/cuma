# Orchestrated mode

Use orchestrated mode when one context cannot hold the task and its verification at full attention. Keep the driver responsible for planning, dispatch, independent verification, integration, and the root report.

## Declare states and paths

Use these leaf states only:

- `WAITING`: one or more ids in `Needs` are not yet `VERIFIED`
- `READY`: dependencies are verified and ownership is available
- `IN-FLIGHT`: dispatched and not yet independently verified
- `VERIFIED`: parent re-verification passed and manual gates were reviewed
- `ABANDONED`: at least one required gate has a recorded handoff; never treat this as full completion

Use `OPEN`, `VERIFIED`, or `ABANDONED` for branches. Store leaf ledgers as `gates/leaf-<id>.md` and integration ledgers as `gates/node-<id>.md`. Do not label a branch path as `leaf-*`.

## Driver loop

1. **Plan before fan-out.** Reread the original request and current amendments. Create `.unlazy/<scope>/PLAN.md`, `.unlazy/<scope>/GATES.md`, and one ledger per leaf and branch from the templates. Inventory every independently omittable outcome and acceptance-changing constraint with a stable id, owner, observing gate or manual review, disposition, and revision. Fix interfaces, naming, toolchain, dependencies, and exact ownership before dispatch.
2. **Inspect and approve checks.** Run `gate-check --status` on every inherited ledger. Review each `CHECK:`, `EXPECT:`, and `CWD:`, including called scripts. Determine the shell and inherited `PATH`; a new oracle with no exact approval prints its resolved values during a normal run without executing. Use `--approve` only after inspection, and do not treat normal mode as a dry run once approval exists.
3. **Claim every concurrent leaf.** Run:

   ```text
   node <skill-dir>/scripts/gate-check.mjs --scope <scope> --leaf leaf-1.2.1 --claim
   ```

   A refused claim means the split is not safe for concurrent dispatch. Change the plan or run the work sequentially; never bypass the refusal.
4. **Launch each ready wave.** Give each leaf only the shared contract, its exact ownership and dependencies, its own ledger, and the four-pass completion rule. Open a dispatch wave for the independent `READY` leaves, call the host's native nonblocking launch once per leaf, record every host handle, and seal the wave before the first wait or result read. Follow [dispatch.md](dispatch.md); do not leak unrelated leaf histories.
5. **Verify each return independently.** Record the native return in its wave, then re-run the returned leaf's runnable gates, including already checked gates:

   ```text
   node <skill-dir>/scripts/gate-check.mjs --root . --cwd . --reverify .unlazy/<scope>/gates/leaf-1.2.1.md
   ```

   `--status` alone is not re-verification. If an approved oracle changed, inspect it and approve the new oracle before continuing. Review manual gates directly and try to refute at least one passed gate.
6. **Append status and roll forward.** Record the result without rewriting history:

   ```text
   node <skill-dir>/scripts/gate-check.mjs --scope <scope> --log "leaf-1.2.1 verified"
   ```

   Mark the leaf `VERIFIED`, release that exact leaf lease, and record the release before promotion:

   ```text
   node <skill-dir>/scripts/gate-check.mjs --scope <scope> --leaf leaf-1.2.1 --release
   node <skill-dir>/scripts/gate-check.mjs --scope <scope> --log "leaf-1.2.1 lease released"
   ```

   Only then promote newly unblocked leaves from `WAITING` to `READY` and dispatch them without waiting for unrelated in-flight leaves.
7. **Integrate bottom-up.** Work each `node-*.md` ledger only after all named children return. Reverify the children, then run interface, end-to-end, and regression checks.
8. **Reconcile, release, and report.** Reread the current request and review every current contract row. Missing/stale ownership or observation, abandonment, deferment, and owner decisions are non-completion. Release the whole scope only after every leaf has settled, every dispatch wave is terminal, branch and root ledgers have been reverified, and final aggregate verification has run. Scope-wide release before that point is reserved for explicit recovery after verifying the recorded owner is gone, never normal promotion. Report only when both the inventory and root ledger are met, then remeasure every reported count.

## Check concurrency

Gate checks run sequentially by default (`--jobs 1`). This is the easiest transcript to debug and is the compatibility behavior.

Use `--jobs <N>` only when runnable gates are independent and parallel execution reduces wall-clock time:

```text
node <skill-dir>/scripts/gate-check.mjs --root . --cwd . --reverify --jobs 4 .unlazy/<scope>/gates/leaf-1.1.1.md .unlazy/<scope>/gates/leaf-1.1.2.md
```

The limit is rolling: start another check when one finishes instead of waiting for a fixed batch. Output and file updates remain deterministic in ledger order. `--jobs` controls command execution, not subagent dispatch and not dependency readiness. Use [dispatch waves](dispatch.md) for native agent concurrency.

## Rolling dispatch

Treat dispatch as a loop:

```text
while an unverified leaf remains:
  collect the independent READY leaves up to the host concurrency limit
  open a dispatch wave for that exact set
  launch every native agent and record every returned host handle
  seal the wave before the first wait
  wait for the next leaf to return
  record that return in its dispatch wave
  reverify that leaf and review its manual evidence
  append status and mark it VERIFIED
  release that exact leaf lease and record the release
  promote each WAITING leaf whose Needs are all VERIFIED
```

Do not invent a dependency during dispatch. Add it to `PLAN.md`, correct the affected states, and record the change. A user amendment increments the contract revision and must be reconciled before more completion credit. Prefer independent leaves, but do not force independence where an interface must be established first.

## Verification hierarchy

1. **Leaf self-check:** catches ordinary incompleteness but remains self-certification.
2. **Parent `--reverify`:** executes each runnable oracle again instead of trusting old or manually written evidence.
3. **Branch integration:** catches locally correct children that do not compose.
4. **Optional Stop hook:** blocks the driver from ending while its resolved pipeline has unmet ledgers or incomplete dispatch waves. It does not execute checks or validate their meaning.

The parent must use the same required toolchain and declared shell. If the environment differs, record and resolve the mismatch instead of accepting old evidence.

## Manual gates

Automation cannot prove every user-facing or judgment-heavy outcome. For each manual gate:

- cite the exact artifact, location, measurement, or reviewer decision
- review consequences, not only visual polish
- obtain independent review for high-risk outcomes when feasible
- keep the gate unmet if evidence is ambiguous

Do not call a leaf `VERIFIED` merely because every runnable gate passed.

## When not to orchestrate

Stay solo when one focused context can implement and verify the task without hiding independent deliverables. Orchestration has planning and integration overhead; use it for attention isolation, not ceremony.
