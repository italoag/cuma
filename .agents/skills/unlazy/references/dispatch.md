# Native agent dispatch

Use this contract whenever orchestrated mode has two or more independent `READY` leaves. Unlazy records native launches; the host creates the agent sessions.

For one wave, every native launch call and every `start` record must finish before the first wait, join, result read, or return record.

## Open and seal a launch wave

Claim every leaf first. Partition more `READY` leaves into later waves when they exceed the host's current concurrency limit. Then open one wave with the exact ids:

```text
node <skill-dir>/scripts/dispatch-check.mjs open --scope <scope> --wave ready-1 --leaf leaf-1.1.1 --leaf leaf-1.1.2
```

For each leaf, call the host's native nonblocking launch tool and record the opaque, nonsecret handle it returns:

```text
node <skill-dir>/scripts/dispatch-check.mjs start --scope <scope> --wave ready-1 --leaf leaf-1.1.1 --handle <host-agent-id-1>
node <skill-dir>/scripts/dispatch-check.mjs start --scope <scope> --wave ready-1 --leaf leaf-1.1.2 --handle <host-agent-id-2>
```

Seal the wave before waiting for any result:

```text
node <skill-dir>/scripts/dispatch-check.mjs seal --scope <scope> --wave ready-1
```

Seal fails until every declared leaf has a distinct start handle. `return` fails before seal. These refusals catch the serial pattern where a driver launches one leaf, waits for it, and only then launches the next.

When a native agent finishes, record the return before parent re-verification:

```text
node <skill-dir>/scripts/dispatch-check.mjs return --scope <scope> --wave ready-1 --leaf leaf-1.1.1
```

A return records scheduler completion, including a failed worker result. It does not mark the leaf `VERIFIED`; the parent still runs the leaf gates and reviews manual evidence.

Check the finished wave with:

```text
node <skill-dir>/scripts/dispatch-check.mjs status --scope <scope> --wave ready-1
```

`status` exits `0` only after every declared leaf returned. Dispatch state and timestamps live in `.unlazy/<scope>/dispatch.json`; lifecycle events also append to the scope status log. The atomic state transition is authoritative: if the later audit-log append is refused, the transition command still succeeds and prints a bounded warning that the state was committed. Inspect state before deciding what to do next; do not blindly repeat the transition.

The state loader requires string ids, handles, and abandonment reasons plus a possible transition history: returns require an all-started sealed wave, terminal timestamps must exist and follow prior transitions, and a fully returned wave must be complete. Hand-editing an impossible terminal state fails closed. The primary `gate-check.mjs --scope <scope>` reduction includes this aggregate state and cannot print `ALL MET` while a wave is open, sealed, abandoned, or invalid.

## Codex adapter

[Current Codex releases support parallel subagents](https://developers.openai.com/codex/agent-configuration/subagents). Use the native subagent tools available in the host. When the tools are named `spawn_agent` and `wait_agent`, follow this exact order:

1. call `spawn_agent` once for each leaf in the open wave
2. record each returned agent id with `dispatch-check start`
3. seal the wave
4. call `wait_agent` only after seal
5. record each completion with `dispatch-check return`, then reverify it

Do not use `codex exec` as a substitute. It creates a separate CLI process rather than a native subagent owned and visible through the current host.

## Claude Code adapter

[Claude Code background subagents run concurrently](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#run-subagents-in-foreground-or-background). Launch every leaf as a background `Agent` task, record every returned task or agent id, and seal before reading any result. Do not issue foreground Agent calls one after another.

For a large regular fan-out, prefer a [Dynamic Workflow](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/workflows). Its `pipeline()` primitive runs agent work across a list under the runtime's concurrency limit. The workflow must still preserve the same semantic barrier: schedule the whole fan-out before collecting its first result. Open a CLI dispatch wave only when the workflow surface exposes a distinct native handle for each agent. Otherwise retain the generated workflow script and runtime progress as branch evidence without claiming a CLI-verified wave.

Do not use `claude -p` as a substitute for an available native background Agent or workflow. A shell process farm loses the current session's native scheduling and observability.

## Failure and fallback

If a native launch fails before returning a handle, leave the wave open, fix the launch problem, and retry that leaf. Do not seal a partial wave. If recovery is impossible, preserve the audit trail instead of inventing a handle or deleting state:

```text
node <skill-dir>/scripts/dispatch-check.mjs abandon --scope <scope> --wave ready-1 --reason "<bounded nonblank reason>"
```

An abandoned wave is terminal and `status` exits `1`. The Stop hook does not block on it, but emits a bounded `HANDOFF REQUIRED` message naming the wave without copying its free-form reason into the privileged host message. Surface the reason from dispatch state in the final handoff. If the host has no nonblocking launch capability, record the limitation in `PLAN.md`, execute a declared sequential fallback, and do not open or describe a parallel wave.

Opening a wave is an execution claim. Do not invent handles, record a foreground result as a start, or call simultaneous work proved merely because commands ran quickly.

## Evidence boundary

The launch barrier proves that the host accepted every native start before the driver accepted a return. It does not prove worker honesty, exact CPU overlap, filesystem isolation, or successful integration. Leases, parent re-verification, and branch gates remain separate requirements.
